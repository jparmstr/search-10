# search-10
A windows program in VB.net that crawls a website with 10 spiders, indexing words, and creating an inverted index which can then be searched by keyword, with the results sorted by relevance.

This is an old project of mine from around 2010. It could really use some refactoring.

The concepts I was tackling:
- Multi threading
- Implementing an algorithm (I was writing from pseudocode on Wikipedia)
- Creating network requests from a Windows application
